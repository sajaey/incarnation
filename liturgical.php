       <h3>Altar Servers</h3>
        <p>Altar servers prepare the altar for the celebration of the liturgy and assist the priest during the liturgy.  Anyone 4th grade and older is eligible.  Servers are usually assigned to the Mass they ordinarily attend, but this may vary depending on the number of altar servers.  </p>
         <h3>Altar Server Coordinator</h3>
        <p>The Altar server coordinator assists in training new servers, in assigning servers for Masses and in preparing servers for special Masses.  </p>
         <h3>Lectors</h3>
        <p>Lectors proclaim the Scriptures at all liturgical celebrations in a manner that enables the assembly to understand and appreciate the beauty and rich content of the Word of God.  They proclaim the first and second readings. Those seeking to participate must have received all three sacraments of initiation: Baptism, First Holy Communion and Confirmation.  </p>
         <h3>Ushers</h3>
        <p>Ushers provide a welcoming presence and sense of hospitality.  They are custodians of order, serving the weekend liturgies as well as major feast days.  They welcome and assist with seating parishioners, assist with the collections, facilitate the presentation of the gifts and assist with procession for Communion.  After Mass, the ushers tidy up the church by picking up loose prayer books and bulletins, placing lost items in the church lost and found and ensuring that doors and windows are closed.  </p>
         <h3>Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion</h3>
        <p>The bishop, priest and deacon are the ordinary ministers of the Eucharist.  Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion are members of the lay faithful who are recommended by the pastor to distribute the Body and Blood of Christ to a specific parish community.  Ministers must be confirmed Catholics in full communion with the Church.  </p>
         <h3>Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion during the Liturgy</h3>
        <p>Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion during the liturgy join the celebrant in distributing the Body and Blood of Christ to the assembly during liturgies.  The frequency of service depends on the number of Eucharistic ministers.</p>
        <h3>Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion to the Sick/Homebound</h3>
        <p>Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion to the sick/homebound are confirmed adult members of the community who bring the Eucharist and “the parish” to the sick and those who are confined to homes, health-care facilities and assisted-living facilities.</p>
         <h3>Music Ministry</h3>
        <p>The music ministry is committed to supporting and enhancing our liturgical prayer life through music.  It comprises vocalists—including cantors and choir members—and skilled instrumentalists.  An audition with the director of music is required, as is regular attendance at rehearsals and parish liturgies. Members of this ministry must be willing to commit to service at liturgies as part of the liturgical team.  </p>
