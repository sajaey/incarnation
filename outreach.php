       <h3>Respect Life</h3>
        <p>Respect Life mobilizes parish energies to work on behalf of life.  This includes issues dealing with the sick and terminally ill, abortion, biotechnology, the elderly and the needs of families.  This ministry serves the unborn child and his or her parents by keeping before their eyes the fact that God is creator of human life, and that we must remain in His presence at all times.  A respect for human life from conception to its natural end is paramount.  Respect Life coordinates an annual baby shower, for which parishioners donate suggested baby items that are then given to a local organization for distribution to the needy in the community, and coordinates the Respect Life annual raffle activities for our parish.  </p>
        
         <h3>St. Vincent de Paul Society</h3>
        <p>The St. Vincent de Paul Society is an international society of lay people dedicated to serving the poor and needy in a face-to-face manner.  The members work directly with families to provide emotional, spiritual and financial support in emergencies.   </p>
        
         <h3>Loaves and Fishes</h3>
        <p>The Trenton Area Soup Kitchen and other organizations serve meals to the hungry in Trenton on weekdays.  There is no meal service on Saturday and Sunday.  A group of churches and other organizations fill that void by serving meals on the weekend.  One such food provider is Loaves and Fishes, held at St. Mary's Cathedral.  One Saturday a year, usually in October, our parish provides and serves this meal. We also provide a second meal in the form of  brown-bag lunches, which are distributed that day. The need is great. More than 800 meals are served on a typical Saturday.</p>
        
         <h3>Christmas Giving Tree</h3>
        <p>Every year a Christmas tree is set up at each church containing tags of suggested items that are needed as Christmas gifts for local organizations, which distribute them to the needy in our community.  </p>
        
        
         <h3>Adopt-a-Family/Adopt-a-Child for Christmas</h3>
        <p>Each year at Christmas, our parish happily accepts the invitation to participate in the Martin House Adopt-a-Family/Adopt-a-Child for Christmas program.  Parishioners who volunteer are provided with the names, ages and sizes of family members so they can then shop for suggested items, usually one toy and one article of clothing per child.  </p>
        
         <h3>Food for the Hungry</h3>
        <p>This ministry collects nonperishable food at all the Masses to donate to the Mount Carmel Guild of Trenton, which is a Catholic organization that gives short-term assistance to families and individuals in crisis. Members of the ministry may use the parish bulletin to request additional food donations before Thanksgiving, Easter and when unexpected events like floods or other natural disasters occur, but the need for food is ongoing, not seasonal.</p>
