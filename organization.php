       <h3>The Rosary Altar Society</h3>
        <p>The Rosary Altar Society is open to all women and men of Incarnation–St. James parish. The society assembles for the 9:30 a.m. Mass on the second Sunday of the month and meets directly after Mass in Trinity Hall. Members honor the Blessed Virgin Mary and seek her patronage through the recitation of the Rosary. The society hosts an annual Spirituali-Tea, open to everyone, featuring an uplifting guest speaker and elegant light refreshments. Members clean and care for the altar and sanctuary of the churches as well as launder the altar linens, emulating Mary as she lovingly cared for the family home. In recent years the society has purchased the New Roman Missals and contributed to the new lighting and other improvements made in both churches. The money for these projects is raised by selling pies at Thanksgiving and palm crosses at Easter and through a Bakeless Cake Sale in the summer.</p>
        
         <h3>The New St. Joseph Society</h3>
        <p>The New St. Joseph Society is a long-standing parish organization founded at St. James to honor the earthly father of Jesus.  Members of the society of Sicilian descent uphold their devotion to St. Joseph, the patron saint of their towns of origin in Italy, through their membership.  The society fosters goodwill, maintaining a common bond among its members through spiritual fellowship and varied activities for the good of the church and its society.  Members are encouraged to be active participants in the society and parish community:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To uphold the concept of Christianity</li>
            <li>To keep alive the spiritual attachment of the traditions of the New St. Joseph Society and the church</li>
            <li>To promote charitable endeavors by assisting church functions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The society sponsors an annual dinner to celebrate St. Joseph’s feast day on March 19.  Here the society presents a St. Joseph’s table and honors guests in the Sicilian tradition.  The society also sponsors the blessing and distribution of St. Joseph’s bread to the parish annually.</p>
        <p>Membership is always open.  The society welcomes new members and shares the joy of traditions and fellowship as it honors St. Joseph, the watchful guardian of the Holy Family.</p>
        
         <h3>The San Calogero Society</h3>
        <p>From the early 1900s through the 1970s, a very large area of North Trenton surrounding St. James Church was comprised of Sicilian immigrants.
San Calogero (St. Charles) is the patron saint of Sicily.  In the early years of St. James, a group of immigrants from the small town of Casteltermini in Sicily formed a committee and sent to their hometown for a statue of San Calogero.  The statue, carved by the sculptor Michele Caltagirone, arrived at St. James Church on Sept. 15, 1923.</p>
<p>The current society officially began on Aug. 2, 1942, under the leadership of Rev. Thomas Rocca, pastor of St. James.  The devotion to San Calogero continues to this day.  To mark the feast of San Calogero in the first week of June, a Mass is celebrated in St. James Church, followed by a traditional Sicilian meal of pasta with eggplant. This dinner is open to all members of our faith-based community. The society meets on the first Sunday of the month in Trinity Hall following the 9:30 a.m. Mass.</p>
        
         <h3>The St. James Senior Citizens’ Club</h3>
        <p>The St. James Senior Citizens’ Club was established more than 30 years ago.  Original membership totaled 500.  Current membership is approximately 120. Meetings are held on the first and third Wednesday of the month except in July and August, when only one meeting is held.  The club is both spiritual and social.  Members  are invited to participate in day trips, multi-night trips and cruises.  The club also supports the parish with contributions for church improvements and necessities.</p>
        
         <h3>The Knights of Columbus</h3>
        <p>The Knights of Columbus in New Jersey is a 64,000-member Catholic fraternal service organization, composed of more than 360 local councils. Our mission to serve our church, our families, our communities and those in need reflects the vision of our founder, the Venerable Fr. Michael J. McGivney. The Knights of Columbus was created more than 130 years ago to support its members in their faith, provide support for their families, and direct their charity to the needs of the less fortunate and the Church. His vision is manifested in three principles of our Order—charity, unity and fraternity. It is the practice of these principles, guided by our faith in the Eucharist, that drives men to join our Order.</p>
        
         <h3>Boy Scout Troop 26</h3>
        <p>The aims of scouting are character development, citizenship training and personal development.  Scouts learn skills such as first aid, cooking, knots, map and compass, camping, hiking and citizenship as they advance through the ranks of scouting.  They test these skills in troop outdoor activities and on camping trips.  Meetings are held on Thursdays from 6:30 to 8 p.m. in the Incarnation auditorium.  Boys ages 11 to 18 are eligible.  </p>
