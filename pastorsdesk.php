                 <p>Welcome to our website! It has been my privilege and blessing from God to be the pastor of Incarnation St. James. May this new website help us continue the good work God has begun among us!! Our web site contains information concerning our two beautiful churches and the various ministries and life of our parish.</p>
                 <p>I pray that you will join us each Sunday or daily for the celebration of the Mass and be an active member of our parish family.  If you are not a practicing Catholic and wish to return to the Sacraments, please contact us.   I warmly and gladly welcome you to Incarnation St. James Parish and to this wonderful website which portrays in just a small fashion who we are and what we aspire to be! I am sure you will find this website full of useful information...
There is no template in evangelizing the Catholic parish. Everyone is a unique faith family. The demographics, the leadership style of the pastor and staff, the cultural and ethnic character of the members—all this and much more determine the means through which a faith community will invite and sustain conversion for its membership. An evangelized parish is in the never-ending process of hearing the Gospel and being formed by it. An evangelizing parish is bringing the Good News of Jesus into every human situation and seeking to convert individuals and society by the divine power of the Gospel itself.</p>
                 <p>The primary dynamic for evangelization is the Holy Spirit. The primary message is the Good News of God’s love for the world. The work of the Holy Spirit within the Christian community forms the person as a disciple of Christ. 
Thanks for visiting us, and if we can be of further help in any way, please let us know!</p>
                 <p>My prayers for you…</br>
                 Fr. Santhosh George OSST,</br>
                Pastor</p>
